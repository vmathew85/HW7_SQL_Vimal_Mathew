# HW7_SQL_Vimal_Mathew

Each question from the homework has been numbered with hashtags. The SQL related to the question is in the following lines after the numbered hastags

For example:

#1a
select first_name, last_name
from actor;

#1b
select concat(upper(first_name),upper(last_name)) AS 'Actor Name'
from actor;


... and so on

Thanks!
